## FFmpeg Examples

For technical users, **FFmpeg** offers a powerful, free way to stream pre-recorded videos. Below is a basic example:

### Stream to an RTMP Endpoint
Stream a video file to a platform like YouTube or Twitch:

```bash
ffmpeg -re -i video.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a aac -f flv rtmp://your-stream-url/stream-key
```


- `-re`: Streams at real-time speed.
- `-i video.mp4`: Specifies the input video.
- `-c:v copy`: Uses the original video codec (no re-encoding).
- `-c:a aac`: Converts audio to AAC for compatibility.
- `-f flv`: Outputs in FLV format (common for RTMP).
- Replace `rtmp://your-stream-url/stream-key` with your platform’s RTMP URL and key.

Find more examples in the [FFmpeg Documentation](https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html).
